	* include/IL/{il,ilu,ilut}.h: Slightly changed syntax of the ILAPI
	macro
	* m4/devil-{definitions,api-checks}.m4: Greatly improved tests for
	libraries in terms of reliability
	* m4/devil-*.m4: Changed shell scripts code so that DevIL can now
	build on OpenBSD (generally on non-bash shells)
	* build-aux/gen_ptr_defines.sh, autogen.sh: Moved code that is
	supposed to generate ptr_defines.h to the autoreconf section of the
	build process
	* src-IL/src/il_stack.c: Put a gettext funcion into conditional code
	* src-IL/src/il_internal.c: Added some logging, substituted generic
	types with DevIL typedefs
	* src-ILUT/src/... : Corrected some old errors coming from earlier
	refactoring
